### Hi there 👋

# ✨ Simply me

"Il computer non è una macchina intelligente che aiuta le persone stupide, anzi è una macchina stupida che funziona solo nelle mani delle persone intelligenti".
This quote by Umberto Eco has always led me to think that computer science should spread throughout our country so to be defined as useful rather than difficult. This is precisely the dream that I, Giulio Melloni, a '94 boy, want to pursue. At the age of 6, I took my first steps on a computer with little more than 128MB of Ram and a HDD not comparable to the one placed on a modern smartphone. Gradually, as I grew up, I got deeper and deeper into the subject, until I studied it in depth by attending the Computer Science & Engineering Faculty with a specialisation in Artificial Intelligence. Working in roles related to the world of Big Data on Azure Cloud, my strong propensity for the world of Software Engineering and my horizontality in the field played a key role in the creation of Big Data architectures that strongly follow DevOps, Agile and software development principles and best practices.
